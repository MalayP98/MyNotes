## Doubts :

* If there is a confirm B/O with good volume, but past few candles have big red volume should that be considered B/O.
* Morning star if red candle's volume is more that green candle's volume?
* How difference between (in percentage) breakout line and wicks.
* 2 touch support are fake support
* Range of support and resistance
* If B/O happens on M then if happens on W before that and D even before that, what to do.
