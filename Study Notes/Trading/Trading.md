## Introduction :

* IPO : Initial Public Offer. Way to introduce a company's share in the market.
* Target : Selling price of a share. Buys a share for 10 then target of 20 means in coming days, months, weeks etc
  this share will/might reach 20.
* Stop Loss : Min selling price to sell a share. Buys a share for 10, it started to fall, 9.5 -> 9 -> 8......
  So stop loss can be 8, making a loss of 2 (Minimum loss you can handle).
* Buy <SHARE_NAME> <BUY_AT> <TARGET> <STOPLOSS>, Example : Buy TATA 400 450 390
* Upper Circuit : Limit above which a share price cannot go in one day.
* Lower Circuit : Limit below which a share price cannot go in one day.

* Colored part of candle is called real body
* Upper line is called upper wick
* Lower line is called lower wick

## Session 2 - 7 Sept 25

<img src="resource/Example2.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Lower wick means sellers are facing resistance or are being rejected. In the above image seller face rejection at 90.
  **Also lower wick denote Bulls**

<img src="resource/Example3.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Upper wick represents buyer were rejected. They took the price till 110 and strong sellers came and took it to 98.
  **Also upper wick denote Bears**

<img src="resource/Example4.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Bear points in above example 950-840 = 110
* Bulls point are 840-800 = 40
* Bear are winners.


* History repeats itself
* Price moves in trend.
* Market discount everything

<img src="resource/Example5.png" width="400" height="300"/>

<img src="resource/Example6.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Stop Loss : This is **recently** clearly visible swing low. Used minimise loss.
* Keep Stoploss 1% below RCVSL.

## Session 4 - 14 Sept

* For newer stock check on 1D
* `Swing high` is needed to decide target.
* `Swing low` i.e stoploss should be one, `Swing High` i.e. target should me multiple.
* `Horizontal Support` : Horizontal line that connect minimum 2 swing lows without breaking any candle
* Cannot trust support if it breaks.
* If support breaks, that mean the buyers dont see worth or seller force is very strong.
* `Horizontal Resistant` : Horizontal line that connect minimum 2 swing high without breaking any candle
* If resistance breaks, that mean either sellers are not selling or buying force is very strong.
* When to buy:
    * if a stock breaks resistance, that mean it'll go high
    * if it hits support and starts moving up, this means it will go till (or might break) resistance.

## Session 5 - 20 Sept

* If we buy at time of support reversal and the support breaks, then sell it below 1% of support.
* Support are of 3 type : Sideways(Horizontal), Up trend, Down trend
* Trend : Start with major swing and should not be very step

## Session 6-7 - 21 Sept/27 Sept

* Buy when prices reverses from support (horizontal / rising) or it breaks resistance.
* 1D : 1M - 1.5Y long support line
* 1W : 5Y-6Y long support line
* 1M : 5Y+ long support line
* Price Action : will use after 1-1.5Y
* Candlestick pattern:
    1. Bullish Engulfing : At support there should be a red candle and next there should be a big bullish green candle
       that covers the previous red candle, also the volume should be good. **2 Candlestick pattern**
       <img src="resource/Example7.png" width="400" height="300"/>
       We have to buy at upper wick of bullish engulfing if the prices sustains for 15 minutes on the next/coming days.
       Don't but until and unless it break bullish engulfing's high (may even have to wait for 10-15 days)
       <img src="resource/Example8.png" width="400" height="300"/>
       Target in this case will be upcoming CVSH and stoploss is when price breaks support/low of bullish
       ==*(Which ever is low)*== engulfing or goes below it.
       If bullish engulfing's low breaks, that means it is a fake engulfing and we should not buy even if in coming days
       the price cross engulfing's high
       <img src="resource/Example9.png" width="400" height="300"/>
       Sometimes bullish engulfing can be fake, some group of buyer buy and raise the price. So follow these pattern on
       a bigger time frame like 1W, 1M and *not 1D*. Only apply these concept in top 100-200 companies of India.
       Confluence of horizontal and rising support can high accuracy.
    2. Hammer : Small real body, Big lower wick. **1 Candlestick pattern**
       <img src="resource/Example10.png" width="400" height="300"/>
       Buy at highest of hammer, Stoploss at min(hammer's low, support). Lower should be min 2x of real body
    3. Morning Star : A big red candle, dogi(indecisive) next, and big green candle that passes mid of the last
       red candle. Buy at high of green candle, Stoploss at Min(Big red, dogi, big green)
       <img src="resource/Example13.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Will used these techniques only on NIFTY 200 stock.

## Session 8 - 28 Sept

* Breakout : Whenever price breaks the resistance *with a view to change the trend*.
  <img src="resource/Example11.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* **A** is Breakout as the price is breaking the resistance and is also changing the trend from falling to rising.
* **B** is *not* a breakout as the price is breaking the resistance but is not changing the trend, trend was rising
  and is still rising.
  <img src="resource/Example12.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* MOTHER : **Valid for 1W | Medium term**
    1. Multiple Touch Resistance.
    2. 3 touch minimum.
    3. 2 touch can be considered if the stock is on all time high.
    4. Buying range 7-8% of break out.
    5. Target : 20-25% of breakout.
    6. Length of resistance *1-1.5Y <*
    7. At breakout, big bullish candle with good real body.

<img src="resource/Example14.png" width="400" height="300"/>

* Points to remember based on above image:
    1. Both are MOTHER.
    2. In the first figure stoploss is lower (60) and in the lower one it is higher (80). Implies Rising support
       is mandatory.
    3. In the first figure buyer are buying at 60 but in the second figure buyer are ready to pay more
       (60 -> 70 -> 80 -> 90), higher lows before breakout
    4. Volume should be high.
    5. SMA 10 should be 12-25% of the price

* Stoploss can be identified based on these conditions:
    1. Recently visible swing lows
    2. Rising or horizontal support
    3. Based on SMA (in later session)

* Multiple touches should be coming closer and closer.

* FATHER :
    1. Falling Trend Line Resistance.
    2. Multiple touches, minimum 3.

    6. Volume should be high.
    7. Trend line should not be very steep

* If there is prior uptrend before MOTHER/FATHER then it works very well
* For FATHER uptrend is mandatory but for MOTHER it is not

## Session 11 - 11 Oct

* In case of MOTHER/FATHER buying range should be 7-8%, if the prices close between 0%-8% of breakout then
  we can buy on Monday/next day. If resistance id 100 and B/O happens between 100-108 we can buy.
