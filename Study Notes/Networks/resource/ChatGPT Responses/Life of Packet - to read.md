# 🧭 The Scenario

You open your browser and type:

https://www.example.com

Your machine:

- IP: `192.168.1.10`
    
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
    
- Default gateway: `192.168.1.1`
    
- DNS server: `8.8.8.8`
    

Destination IP (after DNS resolution):

93.184.216.34

# 🧠 PART 1 — Before Any Packet Exists

When you hit Enter, the browser:

1. Parses the URL
    
2. Extracts hostname: `www.example.com`
    
3. Checks:
    
    - Browser cache
        
    - OS DNS cache
        
    - hosts file
        

If no cached entry exists → DNS resolution begins.

At this moment, **no network traffic yet**.

---

# 🌐 PART 2 — DNS Resolution in Full Detail

Your OS now wants to ask the DNS server:

> "What is the IP address of www.example.com?"

---

## 🔎 Step 1: How does it know where DNS server is?

From DHCP earlier when you connected to Wi-Fi:

- DHCP assigned:
    
    - IP address
        
    - Subnet mask
        
    - Default gateway
        
    - DNS server IP
        

Assume DNS server is:

8.8.8.8

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Is DNS in my subnet?

Your subnet:

192.168.1.0/24

DNS:

8.8.8.8

Binary comparison shows:  
They are not in same subnet.

So OS decides:

> “Send packet to default gateway.”

---

# 🚪 PART 3 — Getting to Default Gateway (Layer 2 Mechanics)

Before sending, your machine must answer:

> What is the MAC address of 192.168.1.1?

It checks ARP cache.

If not found:

### ARP Broadcast Happens

Your machine sends:

Ethernet Frame:  
Destination MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (broadcast)  
Payload: "Who has 192.168.1.1?"

All devices in subnet receive it.

Router replies:

"192.168.1.1 is at AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"

Your machine caches that mapping.

---

# 📦 PART 4 — Birth of the DNS Packet (Encapsulation)

Now packet creation begins.

Let’s build it layer by layer.

---

## Layer 7 — Application Layer

DNS query:

Query: A record for www.example.com

---

## Layer 4 — Transport Layer

DNS uses UDP (usually port 53).

UDP header:

- Source port: random (e.g. 53000)

- Destination port: 53

---

## Layer 3 — IP Layer

IP header:

Source IP: 192.168.1.10  
Destination IP: 8.8.8.8  
TTL: 64  
Protocol: UDP

---

## Layer 2 — Ethernet Frame

Ethernet header:

Source MAC: Your NIC  
Destination MAC: Router MAC

⚠️ Notice:

IP destination = 8.8.8.8  
MAC destination = Router

Because Ethernet only works within local subnet.

---

## Layer 1 — Physical Layer

Bits are converted to:

- Electrical signals (Ethernet cable)
    
- Radio waves (Wi-Fi)
    

Your router receives it.

---

# 🔄 PART 5 — What Router Actually Does

Router removes Ethernet header.

It sees:

Destination IP = 8.8.8.8

It checks routing table.

It finds:

0.0.0.0/0 → ISP next hop

Router then:

1. Decrements TTL (64 → 63)
    
2. Recalculates IP checksum
    
3. Wraps packet in NEW Ethernet frame
    

New frame:

Source MAC: Router's WAN MAC  
Destination MAC: ISP router MAC

Packet is forwarded.

---

# 🌍 PART 6 — Across the Internet

This repeats at every router:

At each hop:

- Layer 2 header changes
    
- Layer 3 stays same (except TTL)
    
- Packet moves closer
    

Eventually it reaches Google's DNS server.

---

# 🧠 PART 7 — DNS Server Response

DNS server builds response:

www.example.com → 93.184.216.34

Now reverse path:

- Source IP: 8.8.8.8
    
- Destination IP: 192.168.1.10
    

Routers forward back using same routing principles.

Eventually your router receives it.

Router sees:

Destination IP 192.168.1.10 is in LAN

Router ARPs for your MAC (if needed).

Delivers final Ethernet frame to your machine.

---

# 🚀 PART 8 — Now Real Communication Begins (TCP)

Now browser knows destination IP:

93.184.216.34

It initiates TCP handshake.

---

## TCP 3-Way Handshake

1. SYN
    
2. SYN-ACK
    
3. ACK
    

Each packet:

- Goes to default gateway
    
- Routed across Internet
    
- Delivered to server
    
- Response comes back
    

Only after handshake:

- TLS handshake happens (if HTTPS)
    
- Certificates exchanged
    
- Encryption established
    

Only THEN actual HTTP request is sent.

---

# 🔁 PART 9 — Cross-Subnet Routing (Deep Explanation)

When sending to another subnet:

Your system performs:

if (destination & subnet_mask) == (my_ip & subnet_mask)  
    send directly  
else  
    send to default gateway

That’s the entire logic.

Routers are just devices with:

- Multiple interfaces
    
- Routing table
    
- Packet forwarding engine
    

They never care about MAC beyond their local segment.

---

# 📡 PART 10 — What Changes at Each Hop?

|Layer|Changes?|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Application|No|End-to-end|
|TCP/UDP|No|End-to-end|
|IP|TTL changes|Checksum updated|
|Ethernet|Yes|Completely replaced|
|Physical|Yes|Depends on medium|

---

# 🌊 PART 11 — What If NAT Exists?

Most home routers do NAT.

Your packet actually becomes:

Source IP: 203.x.x.x (public IP)  
Source Port: translated port

Router keeps NAT table:

192.168.1.10:53000 → 203.x.x.x:61000

When response comes:  
Router checks table and forwards back internally.

Without NAT:  
Private IPs wouldn't work on Internet.

---

# 🔬 PART 12 — Under The Hood Hardware View

Inside router:

1. Packet arrives at interface
    
2. DMA transfers packet to memory
    
3. Forwarding engine checks routing table
    
4. TCAM lookup
    
5. Next-hop selected
    
6. Packet re-written
    
7. Sent to egress interface
    

Modern routers do this in hardware at line speed.

---

# 🧵 PART 13 — What If Packet Is Large?

If packet > MTU:

- Fragmentation happens (rare now)
    
- Or TCP splits into segments
    

Typical Ethernet MTU:

1500 bytes

---

# 🧠 Mental Model Summary

Think of packet life as:

Application data  
   ↓  
Wrapped in UDP/TCP  
   ↓  
Wrapped in IP  
   ↓  
Wrapped in Ethernet  
   ↓  
Converted to signals  
   ↓  
Router unwraps only Ethernet  
   ↓  
Rewraps Ethernet  
   ↓  
Repeat until destination

---

# 🔥 The Most Important Truth

IP is end-to-end.  
Ethernet is hop-to-hop.  
Routers operate at Layer 3.  
Switches operate at Layer 2.  
DNS is just another UDP request.  
Default gateway is just “the next hop for unknown networks”.
